This repository contains implementation of MCTS search algorithm along with orginal checkers made from scratch. It was prepared as a part of 2025's Konik stand for KNSI Golem to provide some form of attraction.

### Code and Files Structure
To ensure a transparent and easily understandable file structure for external users each module, from making plots to training models, is given its respective file in the `src` folder. A full description of the file structure is provided in the [Project Organization](#project-organization) section.

**How to run code in repository?**
Use our packaged modules that strike your interest by importing them to your file of choice. (This repo contains already prepared 'main.py' as a demo)
- Install requirements:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  # Create venv  
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate venv  
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install requirements to venv  
```
- Run code:
```bash
python3 <filename.py>  
```
